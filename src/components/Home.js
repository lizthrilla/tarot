          <p>My fascination with the bizarre stems from my earliest memory.  I was about two when my parents took me up the creaky steps into the attic of my grandmother's house one night.  The room was filled with women's heads.  I don't recall my reaction, but I didn't share this memory until I was an adult and realized Grandma wasn't a serial killer.  She owned a beauty shop and those were mannequin heads.</p>
          <p>When I was about five, one of the first spree killers, Charles Starkweather, killed his girlfriend's family in our neighborhood.  The girlfriend, Caril Ann Fugate, went to the same high school as my brother and sister.  It really freaked out my mother. I remember her picking them up at the school, and she never did that. Once we got home, she locked the doors and pulled the shades and we weren't allowed out until the pair was caught.  Dad was an alternate on the jury and went to the trial every day.  He saved the newspaper clippings and got the autographs of the judge and jury.</p>

      <div className='about2'>
        <p>In 1985, when we were living in Orange County, California, Richard Ramirez, The Night Stalker, terrorized Southern California.  I was very pregnant and home alone a lot while my husband traveled.  That man was freaking scary and his string of murders finally made me agree to buy a gun.  He was caught the day we picked up the .38 at the shop.  I opted to go ahead and get it, because there would probably be another one like him.</p>
        <p>I grew up in a haunted house, although no one saw the ghost but me.  I was always the last to fall asleep, and I slept with a night light so I could see my room clearly.  Most nights, a man would peek in the door and then disappear. Since I could hear my parents sleeping across the hall, I knew it wasn't them. It was probably just a residual thing, because I didn't see him after I moved into the basement bedroom. But it was no big deal, and I just kept it to myself.  I've seen a few ghosts since then, and although skeptics feel the need to tell me it was just my imagination, I'm not prone to hysteria.</p>
        <p>Although I loved writing, it wasn't something girls did.  I knew Willa Cather and Maria Sandoz because I grew up in Nebraska, but we never studied women writers in school, except for a few poets.  I did the practical thing in college, studying math, and decided counting dead people for a living would be fun.  It was.  As a graduate of the University of Nebraska, I hold a black belt in Mathematics as a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries and co-authored the actuarial best-seller, Life, Health, and Annuity Reinsurance, now in its fourth edition with my husband, John.</p>
        <p>My actuarial career to me to Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Newport Beach California.  I was very active in professional organizations, but after the birth of our second child, and a move to Dallas, I decided to plot murders and re-engineered myself into a novelist, taking fiction-writing classes and joining a critique group.</p>
        <p>In 1999, my novel, Calculated Risk won the Greater Dallas Writer's Association Most Publishable Novel, the Millard Lampell Award, the Betty Heinrich's Award, and the CNW/FFWA Florida State Novel Chapter and Best in Fiction Division.  Timberwolf Press published Calculated Risk in 2000 and the audio version was a finalist for the 2001 Violet Crown Audio Book award given by the Texas Writers League.  Unfortunately, marketing was so grueling and there was a backlash against small presses in those days.  After a year, I was exhausted.</p>
        <p>My husband's job took us to New York, and then, Kansas City. With kids in elementary school, I decided it was better to focus on them and didn't actively pursue publication.  However, I remained active in Sisters in Crime and Mystery Writers of America.  I served as President of Partners in Crime, the Kansas City Chapter of Sisters in Crime, and was President of the Guppies, the unpublished writers of Sisters in Crime for three years. I was also a Kansas City Voice for the Kansas City Star for one year, blogging and writing op-eds.  I earned a Master's Degree in Information and Library Science. I learned a great deal about research and technology, and I rediscovered how much I enjoy writing and decided to start over.</p>
        <p>My guilty pleasure is watching paranormal television. I grew up with The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock, and although they were not paranormal shows, some of the stories were terrifying.  Dracula was one of my favorite books in middle school and, a few years ago, I started reading vampire and paranormal books.  I love them and decided to follow this passion and write a paranormal mystery series.   Now that we've retired to Florida, I've found a super supportive group of writers, and I am back at work.</p>
